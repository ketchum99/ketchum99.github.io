									<p>NOTE: THIS HISTORY IS ACCORDING TO STAR WARS LEGENDS, THIS IS NOT CANON, BUT IT DOES HAVE A HIGH CHANCE OF BECOMING CANON. ALSO, THERE WILL BE SOME SPELLING AND/OR GRAMAR MISTAKES IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS. ALL INFORMATION IN THIS TEXT IS TAKEN FROM THE YOUTUBE CHANNEL - STAR WARS EXPLAINED. <a href> https://www.youtube.com/user/starwarsminute </a href></p>
									<p>13,000,000,000 BBY (Before Battle of Yavin) the galaxy is created when a massive amount of dust and gas collapses upon itself and transforms into a spinning disk. Many more billion years go by, planets were created as were the lifeforms that inhabited them. Around 200,000 BBY the biological ancestors to the human race, know as the zel, gained sentience and decided to fight against and defeat the Tongs for coontroll of their planet, Notron, which will later become coruscant. But by 100,000 BBY the sentient lifeforms known as seiestials took over the galaxy by creating advanced technology, Like centre point station (a space station). With their creations, they can create entire worlds, incuding the cirellium system. They enslaved races and put them to work across the galaxy. Around this time, the being known as abaloth gained great power of the force and the dark side (that is not very important for the timeline). Around 90,000 BBY the zel build what will later be known as Galactic City, as humanoid colonists start spreading to other planets. About 36,000 BBY 8 different unknown ships (known as the tho yor) activate on 8 different planets, they sent a signal to all force sensitive beings to board the ships. The ships travel to the planet Tython and the beings soon create the Je di (je-die) order, and the beings who are in this order seek perfect balance in the force. Around a year later at 35,000 BBY the sentient slave beings known as the racata earn their own connection to the force and create new technology, powered by the dark side. They use their new found power against the seistials and overthrow thier masters.</p>
									<p>The Racata spread their influence to eventually become the Infinite Empire. They also enslave races to build new technological terrors, such as the star forge. Nearly 8,000 years later at around 28,000 BBY the Racata attempt to take control of the planet Coraban from the original Sith species. The sith king Aidus successfully drives the Racata away, however the planet is left desolated, the Sith relocate to Ziost and Coraban is left as a holy tomb world. Over all this time, by the year 25,000 BBY the planet Notron is renamed Coruscant and the Zel finished their evolution into becoming Humans. They send out sublight ships (ships that travel at the speed lower than light speed, such as the TIE fighter) to fly to nearby planets and start new colonies. Those colonise then sent out sublight ships of their own, this proccess went on to become very successful. Around the year 25,000 BBY the jedi (je-die) order splits into followers of the light and dark sides of the force. They fight in what will be known as the force wars, each side carries metal swords that glow with the power of the force, kind of like the earliest lightasbers. The followers of the dark side are defeated and exiled, the followers of the light, however, went on to create the Jedi Order and swear to use their knowlage and power of the force to keep peace in the galaxy.</p>
									<p>This page would go on, however this information is taken from the video above and all this text is only 3 minutes into the video, if I went on, this page would be too big and I would have to type for another couple of hours or so. So those are the bare basics of what happened from the year 13,000,000,000 BBY to 25,000 BBY (according to legends). </p>
