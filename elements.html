										<h2 id="content">Movies</h2>
										<p>There are currently 7 Star Wars movies in the franchise: The Phantom Menace (Episode I), Attack of the Clones (Episode II, Revenge of the Sith (Episode III), A New Hope (Episode IV), The Empire Strikes Back (Episode V), Return of the Jedi (Episode VI) and The Force Awakens (Episode VII). Episode IV-VI were made first, with director George Lucas, Episodes I-III were filmed after the first 3 but took place before the original trilogy and these movies were directed also by George Lucas. Although the prequels (most people would agree) are the worst Star Wars movies ever made, or even the worst Star Wars content ever, maybe it's because there are many mistakes, they used lots of CGI or mabye because they are just boring movies. After Disney bought Star Wars on October 30th 2012 for $4.05 billion, Disney said that they would make 3 more Star Wars movies, The Force Awakens, Rogue One and one more unknown one. Episode VII did not disapoint, it looked great had everything great about Star Wars and had great CGI where it was needed. Many people have high hopes for Episode VIII, and we all hope it will do the same, and blow us away with another great Star Wars experience.</p>

												<p>The Bith are a race of aliens with big skulls and long fingers. They are the same species that played at the cantina in Episode IV.
